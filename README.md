## About

Before satellites and fibre optic cables, radio relay towers were once the backbone of global communication. Built on high ground to catch fading signals, these stations would amplify a source and beam it forward to the next point. In other words, it was technology designed to overcome obstacles and boost the work of others.

Somewhere along the line that logic got reversed.

Today's music platforms promise infinite archives with hyper-personalisation. But more often than not they create their own barriers: choice paralysis, recommended-for-you ruts, AI-produced music, and economic dependence on providers with questionable motives. Their primary goal isn't to help you find music. It's to keep you subscribing.

**RELAY RADIO is our attempt to return to the original principles of relay stations and the free internet.**

Born out of a long-term obsession with independent broadcast culture and built to help navigate the stations we've championed for years, we use technology to support diverse musical communities and champion human creativity.

We regard constraints as a feature, not a flaw. We don't want to own your listening experience -- we want to introduce you to the people who do it best. Instead of serving up everything, we relay a curated selection of our favourite internet radio stations for you to listen to. Let serendipity do its thing.

These aren't just radio streams. They're amplifications of real subcultures and tastemakers sharing their records from around the world.

If a station moves you, click through to their site on our Index page. Become a paid supporter and help sustain the DIY communities that keep these vital signals alive.

We believe the internet is at its best when it is open and built together. We'd love to share our framework to help inspire fans to build custom listening experiences for themselves and their communities. So, if you are a builder, designer, or fellow radio obsessive, [get in touch](mailto:tim@jotter.media) to start collaborating.

## Who Made It?

RELAY RADIO is made by [Jotter](https://www.jotter.media/), a London-based consultancy that helps brands build their next chapter through cultural intelligence and creative innovation.

The project is led by founder [Tim Noakes](https://www.timnoakes.com/). From scouting new talent for Radio X and leading editorial at [Boiler Room](https://www.timnoakes.com/boiler-room), to launching [Dazed](https://www.timnoakes.com/dazed-media)'s playlists in the noughties and being a founding DJ at [NTS Radio](https://www.timnoakes.com/ntslive) (hosting the [Synth Hero Show](https://www.nts.live/shows/synth-hero-show) from 2011 to 2019), his career has been defined by helping others discover new creative frequencies.

If you'd like to discuss the project, have a station recommendation, or need help building your own platform, we'd love to hear from you.
