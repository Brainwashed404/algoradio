## About

Before satellites and fibre optic cables, radio relay towers were once the backbone of global communication. Built on high ground to catch fading signals, these stations would amplify a source and beam it forward to the next point. In other words, it was technology designed to overcome obstacles and boost the work of others.

Somewhere along the line that logic got reversed.

Today's music platforms promise infinite archives with hyper-personalisation. But more often than not they create their own barriers: choice paralysis, recommended-for-you ruts, AI-produced music, and economic dependence on providers with questionable motives. Their primary goal isn't to help you find music. It's to keep you subscribing.

**RELAY RADIO is our attempt to return to the original principles of relay stations and the free internet.**

Born out of a long-term obsession with independent broadcast culture and built to help navigate the stations we've championed for years, we use technology to support diverse musical communities and champion human creativity.

We regard constraints as a feature, not a flaw. We don't want to own your listening experience -- we want to introduce you to the people who do it best. Instead of serving up everything, we relay a curated selection of our favourite internet radio stations for you to listen to. Let serendipity do its thing.

These aren't just radio streams. They're amplifications of real subcultures and tastemakers sharing their records from around the world.

If a station moves you, click through to their site on our Index page. Become a paid supporter and help sustain the DIY communities that keep these vital signals alive.

We believe the internet is at its best when it is open and built together. We'd love to share our framework to help inspire fans to build custom listening experiences for themselves and their communities. So, if you are a builder, designer, or fellow radio obsessive, [get in touch](mailto:tim@jotter.media) to start collaborating.

## Who Made It?

RELAY RADIO is made by [Jotter](https://www.jotter.media/), a London-based consultancy that helps brands build their next chapter through cultural intelligence and creative innovation.

The project is led by founder [Tim Noakes](https://www.timnoakes.com/). From scouting new talent for Radio X and leading editorial at [Boiler Room](https://www.timnoakes.com/boiler-room), to launching [Dazed](https://www.timnoakes.com/dazed-media)'s playlists in the noughties and being a founding DJ at [NTS Radio](https://www.timnoakes.com/ntslive) (hosting the [Synth Hero Show](https://www.nts.live/shows/synth-hero-show) from 2011 to 2019), his career has been defined by helping others discover new creative frequencies.

If you'd like to discuss the project, have a station recommendation, or need help building your own platform, we'd love to hear from you.

## More Radio Experiments

We're not the only ones experimenting with radio as an artistic medium in the age of [Algotopia](https://algotopia.xyz). Below is a selection of projects at the forefront of rethinking the modern music experience. They all inspire us immensely and we think they'll inspire you too. Please explore and support their projects.

- **[Cities and Memory](https://citiesandmemory.com/sound-map/)** -- Stuart Fowkes's global sound map presents both the reality of a location and its imagined alternative. Each entry features a faithful field recording and a reimagined remix, creating a collaborative archive that explores the relationship between sound, geography, and human memory.
- **[Drive & Listen](https://drivenlisten.com/)** -- Erkam Şeker's project allows you to virtually cruise through global cities via a dashboard camera paired with local radio. By combining high-definition street footage with live broadcasts, it captures the mundane beauty of everyday life and the unique atmosphere of being a passenger in a foreign land.
- **[Five Radio Stations](https://www.fiveradiostations.com/)** -- Seb Emina and Silvia Guerra present a group show comprising five artworks that also function as live radio stations. Although they are automated, the stations are not on-demand but streamed as live, meaning each listener hears the same thing at the same time as an invisible community of other people.
- **[FMSTREAM](https://fmstream.org/)** -- Gunther Zeilinger's fast, independent database project provides direct access to real stream sources for thousands of global stations. By focusing on bitrates, sample rates, and signal integrity rather than app-based wrappers, it serves as one of the world's most comprehensive tools for technical broadcast enthusiasts and high-fidelity listeners.
- **[Lofi.cafe](https://lofi.cafe/)** -- Fabrizio Rinaldi and Maria Di Vincenzo's minimalist tool gathers the best lofi music streams into a single, distraction-free interface. Designed for focus, the project uses simple keyboard shortcuts to flip through curated channels paired with retro GIF backdrops to create a cosy digital sanctuary for work.
- **[MTV Rewind](https://wantmymtv.vercel.app/)** -- Flexasaurus Rex recreates MTV's golden era with over 88,000 music videos across 56 channels. Built with zero ads, the project focuses on cultural preservation and the shared experience of broadcast television, featuring original commercials and Easter eggs to restore the format of human-curated media.
- **[NINA's Genre Iceberg](https://www.ninaprotocol.com/iceberg)** -- This interactive visualiser serves as a real-time pulse of the underground, asking: how deep does your taste actually go? It reflects Nina's broader mission as a DIY, blockchain-based archive where artists keep 100% of their sales, turning the act of digital digging into a visible badge of honour for those who prefer the deep water.
- **[Poolsuite FM](https://poolsuite.net/)** -- Marty Bell's virtual holiday portal is like living in a sun-drenched, 1980s summer. Using a retro Macintosh-inspired interface, it streams upbeat disco and electronic tracks alongside grainy VHS footage to transport listeners to a permanent state of leisure.
- **[Project Random](https://0xbeef.co.uk/random/radio)** -- Putting the web on shuffle by randomising the algorithms behind social media and streaming platforms, it unearths obscure content you might otherwise never see. It gives forgotten, unseen media from the depths of the internet a chance to be rediscovered by someone, somewhere in the world.
- **[Radio Garden](https://radio.garden/)** -- Jonathan Puckey's project invites you to explore live radio from across the globe via a cartographic window into the world's airwaves. By bringing distant voices close, it connects people across borders, allowing listeners to discover new cultures or re-connect with home from thousands of miles away.
- **[Radiooooo](https://app.radiooooo.com/)** -- Benjamin Moreau and Noemi Ferst's iconic musical time machine allows users to select a country and a decade to hear what was playing there at that time. This collaborative project draws from a global library of music to open horizons through culture and beauty, encouraging users to discover timeless treasures from the collective memory of humanity.
- **[RADIORADIORADIO](https://radioradiorad.io/)** -- Peter Maxwell's project creates a beautiful, static-filled exploratory mode for travelling between a vast array of today's independent internet radio stations. It is designed to encourage a more meditative and intentional way of listening to the global broadcasting landscape through a minimalist, tactile interface that resembles an analogue radio tuner dial.
- **[Sounds of the Forest](https://timberfestival.org.uk/soundsoftheforest-soundmap/)** -- Wild Rumpus's growing soundmap bringing together the aural tones and textures of woodlands from all around the world. Supported by Arts Council England, it collects these unique environmental recordings to create a permanent, immersive record of nature's diverse and fragile ecosystems.
- **[Wild Memory Radio](https://wild-memory-radio.wetransfer.com/)** -- Seb Emina has created a gallery that stores memories tied to specific locations rather than physical objects. It explores the "sense of place" by pairing human narratives with AI-generated approximations of the locations and memories described.
